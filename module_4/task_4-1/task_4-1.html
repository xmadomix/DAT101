      <li>[Why is object-oriented development so important in programming?]</li>
      <p>[Object-Oriented development is important because it keeps the code scalable, clean and maintainable. it has the ability to model different systems used irl, reusability, and alignment with modern practices. not every project needs OOD, its principles are invaluable for complex or long-term projects. ]</p>
      <li>[In Task 1, we create a static object called "AccountType." Explain what this object is used for and
        how this type of object can help us in software development.]</li>
      <p>[This is an object that helps us managing our constants systematically.This keeps the information the bank accounts and other saving accounts organized."Accounttype" is a static ibject making it a good practice helps us organizing fixed values and ensures reliabililty in the codebase.]</p>
      <li>[Discuss why we use encapsulation in classes. Why do we want to "hide" code within our class?
        Explain how we can create "private" and "public" members in a constructor function.]</li>
      <p>[we use encapsulation in clases because we involves bundling data and methods into a single unit (whic is class) while controlling access through specific mechanisms. Encapsulation is a fundemental principle of object-oriented programming. this make sure that data is protected, enhanced flexibility, and enhances code clarity and maintainability by managing access to private and public members. ]</p>
      <li>[Explain what happens when we use the "new" command in JavaScript.]</li>
      <p>[when we use the "new" command, especially in javascript, we create an instance of a constructor function, or class. The new command automates object creation, binds this, runs the constructor, and returns the object, simplifying instance creation in JavaScript.]</p>
