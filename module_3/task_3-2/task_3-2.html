      <li>[In part 1, is it possible to solve the problem using a single "for" loop?]</li>
      <p>[not quite, yes you can use "for to solve the problem in part 1, but you need to state "for" two times to be able to solve part 1 as you are counting "1 to 10" and "10 to 1", where you show that you need to put two separate loops to achieve salvation for part 1 ]</p>
      <li>[In part 2, can we create what is known as an "infinite" loop within the condition of the "while" loop?
        Describe what would or would not be necessary to achieve this. Provide a thorough explanation of
        your answer.]</li>
      <p>["infinite" is quite interesting as at infite can be limitless, even for a program. But yes, you are able to create "infinite" loop with the condition of "while", The computer "loop" with "while" is endless. the condition of the loop always evaluates to "true" which basically continiously running the loop untill it is manually stopped, like what was done in task part 2.   ]</p>
      <li>[Discuss briefly how quickly or slowly a computer might be able to compute this, considering the
        number of guesses and the time it takes. How does the program behave while it is guessing? Can
        the program perform other tasks concurrently?]</li>
      <p>[wth one task it only up for the program on how long it takes to run, but it is possible for the computer to compute more task, and most times it can be fast at running, but in very rare cases, if the code is very long, it mighy be to heavy and run for a while (or generally something is wrong with the code) Generally, the program loads almost imidielty in most cases, it even peforms other section that you have coded while guessing another task.]</p>
      <li>[Explain the relationship between rows and columns in nested "for" loops. Can we, for instance,
        change the order, considering rows to be innermost or columns to be innermost, or does this not
        matter?]</li>
      <p>[we can alter and change the "nested" "for" loops, as if you change the order, it can affect which order the values are at, but overall there is not much change. there can be accidents on accidently altering too much for it to spawn another row, or that some values are at the wrong direction of the row/column,so in a sense, it does matter a bit, when you want to be precise on creating rows and columns]</p>
