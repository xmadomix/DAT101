      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 1, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>[in part 1, we explore the "if", "else" and "else if" in the setting of waking up for school. 
        When we use the specific values to determine whether we make it to the bus or not, we use the "if", "else" and "else if" to determine whether the values (in this case time) are able to surpass the statement made. if you set the value as 7, you can make it to school, however that shows the same if you
        go around 6, because its before 7. if the time is 8, the program shows that you wont make it, because its over 7 and therefore you're not
        able to make it to the bus. ]</p>

      <li>Discuss the behaviour of part 2, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>[Same as question #1 How ever the answer should now be different. Just like mentioned over, we make an else if statement, where we want to tell that if we were to wake up around 8, we have to take the other option from the first we originially had. The other option is to take the car to school. this means that when you wake up 7, you can make the bus, but later than that, instead of not making it to the bus, you can take the car instead of the bus to get to school.  ]</p>
        
      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 3, what happens when wake time is less than 7 or greater than 8?</li>
      <p>[if you were to set the wake up time exactly 8, you will have to take the train to school, otherwise any greater than that you will have to take the car, as our values and statements says that if we wake up at "#" hour, we are able/not able to take the bus, but we can 
        take another option, and if were later than that option, there is a spare option as well. this is by the use of us all ready stating our if (wake up time at 7) and else if (wake up time at 8) and else, which, if we dont wake up at neither times, we have to take the car instead of th bus or train]</p>

      <li>Discuss the behavior for part 4, what happens if the number is exactly 0, is zero positive or negative?</li>
      <p>[when the number is exactly 0, the value becomes neutral, because its neither positive or negative, but its in between these two sides, and you're able to test so by changing the values. doing this you allready have to state if and else/ else if, to show both the negative and neutral results in the output, and for the neutral output aswell.  ]</p>
